# ML-AI-Final-Project
Codecademy Machine-Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals Final Data Analysis Project

Project Scope:
Looking for correlations outside of music genre with lower self-reported mental health issues. What can people do with regards to their music listening habits to help alleviate feelings of OCD, insomnia, anxiety or depression?

Steps:
1. Identify survey variables that are reasonably changeable by the participant (e.g. number of hours listened, playing an instrument, listening while working, etc.)
2. Look for correlations between these variables and reported levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and OCD.
3. Identify survey variables that are relatively FIXED in the participant (e.g., age, favorite genre, etc.)
4. Look for correlations between these variables and reported levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and OCD.

Analysis results:

1. According to the data, there are no strong correlations between the variables measured and reported levels of anxiety, insomnia, depression and OCD.
2. There seems to be some connection with listeners whose favorite genre being gospel music being much older than the mean sample age, and these listeners have comparatively lower reported levels of anxiety and depression with comparatively higher reported levels of insomnia. However, these values are largely within one standard deviation of the corresponding sample means.
3. The higher levels of insomnia may be more connected to being older in age than being connected to listening to gospel music.
4. The lower levels of anxiety and depression may be connected to stronger religious faith or a sense of existential purpose that would make people more likely to prefer gospel music.
